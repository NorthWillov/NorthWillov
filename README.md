### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End Developer with hands-on to build user-friendly and professional looking sites. I have knowledge to solve a problem across many mediums and especially adept at taking an already existed project to the next level. With every project I aim to make the user experience intuitive and easy to follow for any level of user. I look forward to using my skills as a developer and designer as part of a quality-driven team to build easy-to-use and professional looking sites.
